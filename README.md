# Recommender_System
This task was part of the assignment in the course SDSC 3002 (Data Mining) taught by Dr.Yu Yang at City University of Hong Kong. The task was as follows:

Download the files "training.txt", "testing.txt" and "item_tag.txt". In the file "training.txt", each line is in the form

which means the rating of user u, on the item i is ![CodeCogsEqn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60958440/188551677-d7c6b1e5-e048-45c4-b046-976d3b0527a0.gif).

In the file "testing.txt", each line is represented by u,i,? which means you are required to predict the rating of user u on item i. Use the training dataset "training.txt" to build a recommender system and make predictions for the testing dataset "testing.txt" by replacing all the "?" with your predicted ratings. All the ratings are within the range [0,5].

You may also want to use the file "item_tag.txt", where each line ![CodeCogsEqn (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60958440/188551961-75a67be2-f647-4e7b-885e-998d871a3597.gif) indicates that the item i has tags ![CodeCogsEqn (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60958440/188552034-0519c725-53f7-41eb-80cc-f307f723893a.gif). Note that some items may not have any tags so it is normal if you cannot find some items in the file "item_tag.txt".
